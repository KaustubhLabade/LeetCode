During my LeetCode practice in Java, I have acquired and honed a range of valuable skills:

1. **Problem-Solving Abilities**: Improved my ability to analyze complex problems, break them down into manageable parts, and devise efficient solutions.

2. **Algorithmic Thinking**: Developed a strong understanding of various algorithms, including sorting, searching, and graph algorithms, and learned when and how to apply them effectively.

3. **Data Structures Mastery**: Gained proficiency in using essential data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hashmaps, and trees, understanding their implementation and performance trade-offs.

4. **Code Optimization**: Learned to write clean, efficient, and optimized code, focusing on time and space complexity to ensure solutions are both correct and performant.

5. **Debugging Skills**: Enhanced my debugging skills, becoming adept at identifying and fixing errors and bugs in my code through systematic testing and analysis.

6. **Java Proficiency**: Deepened my understanding of Java, including its syntax, libraries, and best practices, leading to more robust and maintainable code.

7. **Time Management**: Improved my ability to manage time effectively, balancing between understanding the problem, planning the solution, and implementing it within a reasonable timeframe.

8. **Attention to Detail**: Sharpened my attention to detail, ensuring that my code adheres to given problem constraints and edge cases are handled appropriately.

9. **Resilience and Patience**: Developed greater resilience and patience, learning to persist through challenging problems and setbacks, and approaching each new problem with a positive mindset.

10. **Communication Skills**: Enhanced my ability to communicate technical concepts clearly and concisely, both in written form (through comments and documentation) and verbally (explaining my thought process and solutions).

These skills collectively contribute to my growth as a proficient programmer and problem solver, preparing me for real-world software development challenges.
